# Some further setup instructions for QOL improvements

## Set a directory for screenshots

This keeps screenshots taken via `shift-cmd-3` and `shift-cmd-4` from cluttering the Desktop (the default setting). If you don't take many screenshots feel free to ignore.

For modern (Catalina and further) macOS versions:

- Open the screen capture dialog using `shift-cmd-5`
- Select the `Options` menu item
- Designate any destination you prefer (I create a Desktop folder called `screenshots` and select it under `Other Location...`)
